Sierra

This template brings an interface inspired by Sierra's classic point-and-click games from 1990s, such as King's Quest VI. It features a top bar with icons for actions like Walk, Look, Talk, and Interact, along with an inventory. Clicking the icons sets the cursor mode, and players can also use the mouse wheel to cycle through these cursor. The top bar also includes icons and GUIs for saving and loading the game, adjusting settings, and exiting the game.
